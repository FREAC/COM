As a bilingual, bi-cultural therapist, I enjoy working with people of diverse ethnic backgrounds, cultures, gender, and sexual orientations. My approach to therapy is founded on the belief that people can change aspects of their life that no longer accurately represent who they are or how they want to be perceived by others. I work with each individual to modify thinking patterns to maintain positive self-value over the course of their lives despite of what kind of challenges face them. I aim to create a safe space for positive and long lasting change. I believe in the power of choice, and focus on strengthening the willingness to improve and succeed.

Every session with me will focus on YOU: together we'll examine ways that you are limiting your life. We'll build your self-awareness, creating lasting changes for you and increasing your self-esteem.

Monthly chapter meetings offer friendship, caring and a safe place for bereaved parents, grandparents and siblings to discuss their grief with others who understand. The Tallahassee chapter offers a library of grief books, pamphlets, a quarterly e-newsletter and other support resources. We hold a Candle Lighting program on the second Sunday every December in memory of our loved ones.  The secret of TCF's success is simple: As seasoned grievers reach out to the newly bereaved, energy that has been directed inward begins to flow outward and both are helped to heal.  Our ongoing goal is to provide support, friendship, understanding and hope. Every day, The Compassionate Friends work to support, educate and connect families who have suffered the death of a child.
